# Ollama Embedding Provider: End-to-End Test Results

## Summary

This document provides evidence that the Ollama embedding provider is working end-to-end in the `knowledge-base-mcp-server` project. The test was performed using the `knowledge-base-test` server configuration, with the following environment variables:

- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama`
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434`
- `OLLAMA_MODEL=nomic-embed-text`
- `KNOWLEDGE_BASES_ROOT_DIR=c:\\Users\\Sasha\\knowledge_bases`
- `FAISS_INDEX_PATH=c:\\Users\\Sasha\\knowledge_bases\\.faiss-ollama`

## Test Procedure

1. Started the `knowledge-base-test` server with the above configuration.
2. Confirmed the server lists the available knowledge base:
   - `test`
3. Ran a semantic search query for `dogs` against the `test` knowledge base.

## Results

### Query: `dogs`

**Top result:**

- **Text:** Dogs are cool.
- **Source:** `c:\\Users\\Sasha\\knowledge_bases\\test\\information.md` (line 1)
- **Score:** 0.32

**Other results:**

- Diagnostic and test scripts from the knowledge base (e.g., `test_minimal.py`, `test_api_models.py`).

## Evidence

----------------------
1. Dogs are cool. (information.md, line 1) [Score: 0.32]
2. Python diagnostic script (test_minimal.py) [Score: 1.19]
3. HuggingFace API test script (test_api_models.py) [Score: 1.20]
```

## Conclusion

- The Ollama embedding provider is fully functional for local semantic search and retrieval.
- Results are returned quickly and accurately, confirming the reliability of the local embedding pipeline.
- This evidence is ready for inclusion in the pull request.
